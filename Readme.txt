This was an academic project done with the purpose of implementing a natural language processing Hidden Markov Model Part of Speech (POS) tagger which reads each word in a text file and assigns to it a part of speech such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., based on some training data.

The data corpus used is a Catalan part-of-speech tagging corpus. The hmmlearn.py takes one argument which is a training data file from the catalan corpus. It then creates a hmmmodel.txt file which acts an input for the hmmdecode.py along with a dev_data file which is then tagged.

The	accuracy achieved was 93%.
Used python and its standard libraries to implement the HMM POS tagger.


This project was done in Jan 2017.
